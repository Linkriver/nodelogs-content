## GasEstimator

The GasEstimator can either run in `BlockHistory`, `FixedPrice` or `Optimism2` mode and manages the setting of the gas price for the Chainlink nodeâ€™s outgoing transactions. The safest way to prevent stuck or overpaid transactions on most networks is to run the `BlockHistory` mode.

## [WARN] BlockHistoryEstimator: GAS_UPDATER_BLOCK_HISTORY_SIZE= is greater than ETH_FINALITY_DEPTH=, blocks deeper than finality depth will be refetched on every block history estimator cycle, causing unnecessary load on the eth node. Consider decreasing GAS_UPDATER_BLOCK_HISTORY_SIZE or increasing ETH_FINALITY_DEPTH
The BlockHistoryEstimator listens for new heads and updates the base gas price dynamically based on the configured percentile of gas prices in that block.

## [WARN] BlockHistoryEstimator: error fetching blocks
The Chainlink node is not able to fetch the block from its remote RPC endpoint (full node).
- Check the blockchain connection of the Chainlink node (e.g. the Full-node-as-a-Service subscription and renew or switch the plan if necessary to prevent RPC rate limits from being hit)
- Run an own full node with custom configuration and no performance restrictions

## [ERROR] BlockHistoryEstimator: cannot fetch, current block height is lower than GAS_UPDATER_BLOCK_DELAY=
The block delay variable determines the number of blocks that the block history estimator trails behind the head and thus which block to fetch. 
- Check the `BLOCK_HISTORY_ESTIMATOR_BLOCK_DELAY` setting and decrease it if necessary 
- Restart the node to apply the changes to the environmental file

## [WARN] BlockHistoryEstimator: cannot calculate percentile gas price
The Chainlink node cannot set a new default gas price as there are no suitable transactions in the block history to calculate the percentile gas price to choose.

## [WARN] Calculated gas price of Wei exceeds ETH_MAX_GAS_PRICE_WEI=, setting gas price to the maximum allowed value of Wei instead
The Chainlink node cannot set the new default gas price as its set maximum of `ETH_MAX_GAS_PRICE_WEI` would be exceeded. Transactions will never be sent with a higher gas price, the default values for this setting are chain-specific. 
- Check if the target network is facing any gas price abnormalities
- Increase `ETH_MAX_GAS_PRICE_WEI` if necessary 
- Decrease `BLOCK_HISTORY_ESTIMATOR_TRANSACTION_PERCENTILE`  if necessary
- Restart the node to apply the changes to the environmental file

## [WARN] Calculated gas price of Wei falls below ETH_MIN_GAS_PRICE_WEI=, setting gas price to the minimum allowed value of Wei instead
The Chainlink node cannot set the new default gas price as it would fall below its set minimum of `ETH_MIN_GAS_PRICE_WEI`. Transactions will never be sent with a lower gas price, the default values for this setting are chain-specific. 
- Decrease `ETH_MIN_GAS_PRICE_WEI` if necessary
- Increase `BLOCK_HISTORY_ESTIMATOR_TRANSACTION_PERCENTILE`  if necessary
- Restart the node to apply the changes to the environmental file
